## 🎯 Executive Summary
In modern oilfield operations, downtime is the enemy of profitability. This project introduces an **AI-Driven Diagnostic System** that goes beyond simple threshold alerts. By analyzing multi-sensor correlations, the system identifies **Mechanical Anomalies** before they lead to catastrophic failure.

## 🚀 Key Innovations
- **RUL Integration:** Real-time tracking of **Remaining Useful Life** to predict equipment collapse.
- **Smart Root Cause Analysis:** Automatically identifies if an anomaly is due to *Bearing Wear*, *Cavitation*, or *Leakage* based on sensor cross-correlation.
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment:** A Neon-themed dashboard providing a "Health Score" for critical pumps and compressors.

## 🔬 Technical Insight (The Sulaiman Model)
During development, we discovered a strong **Negative Correlation (-0.47)** between High-Frequency Vibration (Sensor 10) and Equipment Health. This project utilizes that mathematical insight to trigger early warnings when the system detects "Vibration Drift."



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Data Engine:** Pandas & NumPy
- **Diagnostics:** Scikit-Learn (Anomaly Detection Algorithms)
- **Visualization:** Plotly Interactive Subplots

## ⚙️ Deployment
To run this analyzer locally:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `streamlit run anomaly_diagnostic_app.py`
